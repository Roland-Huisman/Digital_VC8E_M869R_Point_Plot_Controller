Digital VC8E M869R Point Plot Controller

This is a 74xx clone of the Digital Digital VC8E M869 Point Plot Controller for the DEC PDP8/E family computers. It's called the VC8E M869R. Please note, this is a two board set. You need the VC8E M885R D/A controller as well...

If you happen to have an original M885 board, you can use it together with the VC8E M869R controller.

There are no DEC or SP chips used. Only 74xx and 74HCTxx series chips are used. It passes the DIRXAC maindec and boots OS/8.

I hope to do some more redesigns of several Omnibus boards. Prices are getting insane and in this way you can build as many boards as you want to have. If you want to built these boards and sell them on Ebay, you are more then welcome to do that. In this way you can help other people to get these boards which probably are not able to solder them by them self.

All documents are profided as-is. I have to check which lisence is the best suitable for the project.

Regards, Roland
